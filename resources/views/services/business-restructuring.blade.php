        We help and advise business owners with financial problems every day. We have an acute awareness of how stressful it can be when your business runs into difficulty. Some situations are simple to resolve, others are more complicated, involving multiple international jurisdictions.

        We work closely with other professionals such as bankers, venture capital funds and lawyers to restructure and refinance struggling organisations, across numerous industry sectors on projects that are both national and international. The priority is to focus on recovery — both the business and its corporate structure. Many businesses can avoid administration or liquidation by seeking professional advice as early as possible.
